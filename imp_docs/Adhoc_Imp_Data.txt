A memorable journey

My last day in class 3


In my last summer vacation i travelled to my grandparent place by train. Train journeys 
are always fun. I have been travelling by train since my childhood. My maternal grandparents live in Darbhanga, while we live in pune. In train
journey i love sitting at window seat and watching outside. This time luckily we got lower berth. I just love the sight of green fields, trees,huts and water bodies.
During night we ate delicious biryani which was cooked by my mother. I also watched one of my favourite movie on my Father's laptop before sleeping in night.


played game
no study
full class decorated
exchanged snax

Last day of class 3 was very funny. Our final exam was finished and summer vacation was starting, so we were very happy when we reached to school. When my class
teacher came in the class then she said that there will be no study today. She told everyone to tell about their plan of spending summer vacation. After some time we
played lots of games.  Once game was finished then class teacher said that today there will be decoration competition between all sections of class 3. I started decorating 
class with my friends. We enjoyed decorating our class and had lots of fun. We also went to library in the last period. Library mam said that we can issue book for whole duration
of summer vacation. I took one of my favourite book. Last day of class3 was really memorable.

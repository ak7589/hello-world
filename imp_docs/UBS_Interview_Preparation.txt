first round was hackerrank test. its 2 hr coding test with 5 questions. 

one question was on collision course which i left as its time consuming.
 second was easy one inheritance.

 
 third was lengthy with writing apis, service and repo on spring boot (github query api).
 
 hird was lengthy with writing apis, service and repo on spring boot (github query api).
 
 
 this one was lengthy and would take itself more than 2 hours.
 last 2 one was sqls. 
 overall a bad experience as first and third really do not fit into 2 hour round and need more time. quite unrealistic expectations.


write github query api (6 functions)

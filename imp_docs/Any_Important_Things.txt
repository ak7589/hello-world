//Temp Story 1

It was a rainy season and I had gone to my maternal grandfather house. My cousins had also come there and we were staying together. In the evening there was a movie called "Makdee"
coming on TV and we saw that movie together. That film was a story of fight between a little girl and a witch and we really got scared after watching that movie.

After watching the movie and completing dinner we went for sleep. After sometime i heard sound of thunder from distance  which was  getting closer by each passing minute. I woke up and saw that my cousins were not sleeping in the spare beds in my room. I got sacred as i was alone in the room and suddenly horror scenes of movie i watched flashed in my mind. Suddenly
there was a power cut and it was dark everywhere. Suddenly there was a lightning flash and the associated thunder, and in that light i felt as i have seen witch in front of me. I got
very scared and ran towards gate of the room to go to my mother's room. I accidentally bumped into the wall. This made me feel dizzy. I got up again and ran towards my mother's
room. When i reached there i saw everyone is sleeping and also found my cousin sleeping there. Later he told me that he came to this room because he was getting scared because of thunderous noise.

That was my most frieghting experience.


It was summer vacation and one day there was no power in my house because of transformer of my society was not working because of some problem. I was getting very bored as i was not 
able to watch TV or play any video game. After sometime i remembered that i received few gifts from my friends on my birthday which was not yet opened. I started opening those gifts
along with my brother. I found that there is a caramboard, ludo and a business game in the gifts given by my friend. We stared palying caramboard first. I had played caram earlier but that board was big. This caram board was of little smaller so we were able to score more easily. We enjoyed a lot palying caram board. After sometime we got bored and we thoght to play some other game. Then we started playing business game. This game was totally new to me as i was playing it for first time. We read the game manual first and then we understood how to play business game. We enjoyed palying business game very much. Most funny part of the game was about returning change. We has to do addition and substraction real time which was a fun.

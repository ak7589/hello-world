Strategy Pattern Notes : - 

1. Externalizes alogorithm
2. Client knows different strategy
3. Typically there is a class per strategy
4. Reduces conditional statement

We have example of Credit card demo where we have diffferent strategy for the credit card validation depending upon credit card type i.e 
visa card / or master card. We have a ValidationStrategy abstract class and it has two implementations one each for Visa credit card and Master credit card.
Credit card class has private member variable of type ValidationStrategy and appropriate class is passes to the Credit card at creation time through constructor


Template Pattern Demo...

1. It gurantees algorithm adherence. For example we defineed a abstract class OrderTemplate and it has a final method processOrder...By making this mmethod final we mase sure that
it cannot be over-ridlden...So child classes like WebOrder and StoreOrder can just override methods which are called in the final method "processOrder". That is whay it is called

"algorithm adherence".

cpllection vs streams

//Functional programming definition
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

//Functional interface
A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains only a single abstract (unimplemented) method. A functional interface can contain default and static methods which do have an implementation, in addition to the single unimplemented method

//Why to use functional interfaces
The major benefit of java 8 functional interfaces is that we can use lambda expressions to instantiate them and avoid using bulky anonymous class implementation. Java 8 Collections API has been rewritten and new Stream API is introduced that uses a lot of functional interfaces.

//Java8 features
Lambda expressions,
Method references,
Functional interfaces,
Stream API,
Default methods,
Base64 Encode Decode,
Static methods in interface,
Optional class,

//What is stream in Java8 
Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. ... Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result

//Spring IOC Container
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_ioc_containers.htm#:~:text=The%20Spring%20container%20is%20at,that%20make%20up%20an%20application.

There are basically two types of IOC Containers in Spring: BeanFactory: BeanFactory is like a factory class that contains a collection of beans. It instantiates the bean whenever asked for by clients. ApplicationContext: The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface

//Spring beans scope
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_bean_scopes.htm#:~:text=If%20the%20scope%20is%20set,singleton%20scope%20for%20stateless%20beans.

//Spring profiles
https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-profiles-1

//What is AutoWiring ?
Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or constructor injection. Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values. It works with reference only.

first round was hackerrank test. its 2 hr coding test with 5 questions. one question was on collision course which i left as its time consuming. second was easy one inheritance. third was lengthy with writing apis, service and repo on spring boot (github query api). this one was lengthy and would take itself more than 2 hours. last 2 one was sqls. overall a bad experience as first and third really do not fit into 2 hour round and need more time. quite unrealistic expectations.

To create user in MySQL/MariaDB 5.7.6 and higher, use CREATE USER syntax:

CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
then to grant all access to the database (e.g. my_db), use GRANT Syntax, e.g.

GRANT ALL ON my_db.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
Where ALL (priv_type) can be replaced with specific privilege such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, etc.

Then to reload newly assigned permissions run:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


{
    "memberId" : "ak7589",
	
"prodList" : [
   {
      "productCode":"71",
      "productName":"SUKEN_LEVEL1_PREMIUM"
   },
   {
      "productCode":"31",
      "productName":"EIKEN_LEVEL1_PREMIUM"
   },
   {
      "productCode":"51",
      "productName":"KANKEN_LEVEL1_PREMIUM"
   }
]

}


[
   {
      "id":28,
      "Title":"Sweden"
   },
   {
      "id":56,
      "Title":"USA"
   },
   {
      "id":89,
      "Title":"England"
   }
]
